# koffe_things
An Android things with companion app project. Helps with the extremely important process of brewing coffee.

The idea is an Android things based solution to https://www.homegrounds.co/aeropress-water-temperature/ 

We have an android things app/ board which is attached to a liquid temperature sensor which is inserted into the kettle somehow. 
The user selects the brewing temperature they want, switches the kettle on and they are notifed once boling is complete and the water
has cooled to the required temperature.
